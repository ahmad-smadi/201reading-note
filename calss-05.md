## images
### choosing images for your site 
- a picture can say a thousnd words , and great image help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one 

### adding images 
To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes 

src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site.
alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
title : You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image

### height and width of image 
hightn: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

width : This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
