# 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS 

## fade in 

* Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change, for example on hover 

* for example

## Change color 

* Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them 


##  Grow & Shrink 
* To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge 

* Shrinking an element is as simple as growing it. To enlarge an element we specify a value greater than 1, to shrink it, we specify a value less than 1 


## Rotate elements 

* CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS 


## Square to circle 

* transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property 

## 3D shadow 
 
 * 3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design 

* This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen 

## Swing 
* we need to use @-webkit-keyframes as well as @keyframes  

## Inset border 
* One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow. 


# Transforms 
* The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values 

## Transform Syntax 

* including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses 

# Transitions & Animations 

* With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted 

* Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes
